		<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>

		<section>
	
		    <p>
		      <em>JavaScript</em>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. About 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      <em>JavaScript</em> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It features dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles and provides APIs for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      The ECMAScript standard itself does not include input/output (I/O) capabilities like networking or graphics. These are provided by the browser or runtime environment. JavaScript engines, originally used only in browsers, are now widely embedded in servers and apps — with Node.js being a popular example.

		    <h3>Client-side Usage</h3>
		
		    <p>
		      <em>JavaScript</em> is the dominant client-side scripting language on the Web. It allows scripts to be embedded in or included from HTML documents, enabling dynamic behavior and interaction with the DOM. Nearly all websites rely on JavaScript to enhance user experience and functionality.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		      Modern web browsers include built-in JavaScript engines that execute scripts directly on the user's device, contributing to responsive and interactive web pages.

		    <h3>Examples of Scripted Behavior</h3>
		
		    <ul>
		      	<li>Loading content without reloading the page (e.g., via Ajax or WebSockets).</li>
		      	<li>Animating webpage elements — such as fading, resizing, or moving objects.</li>
		      	<li>Controlling media playback directly in the browser.</li>
		      	<li>Generating alert boxes or pop-up messages.</li>
		      	<li>Validating form input before submission to the server.</li>
		      	<li>Tracking and logging user behavior for analytics and personalization.</li>
		      	<li>Redirecting users to different pages or sections.</li>
		      	<li>Storing and retrieving data locally using Web Storage or IndexedDB.</li>
		      	<li>Enabling in-browser games or complex user interactions.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <h3>JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
	
		    <p>
		      	<em>JavaScript</em>'s capabilities are extended by a wide variety of libraries and frameworks, which simplify complex tasks and accelerate development. These include tools like React, Angular, and Vue. While they are critical to modern development, they are discussed in detail in a separate section on <a href="frameworks-blog.html">Web Frameworks</a>.
