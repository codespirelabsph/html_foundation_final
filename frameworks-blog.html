	    	<h3>Understanding Web Frameworks</h3>
	    	<p>
	      		A <strong>web framework</strong> is a software platform designed to simplify the process of developing web applications and websites. It provides developers with a structured foundation made up of reusable components, libraries, and tools that handle many of the common tasks involved in web development—such as routing, database operations, session management, form handling, and security.
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	      		Rather than writing every line of code from scratch, developers use web frameworks to save time and effort, allowing them to focus on the unique features and functionality of their application.
	    	</p>

	    	<h3>Why Use a Web Framework?</h3>
	    	<p>
	      		Web development without a framework is like building a house without a blueprint—it’s possible, but difficult, disorganized, and prone to errors. A good web framework:
	    	</p>
	    	<ul>
	      		<li>Speeds up development with built-in features</li>
	      		<li>Promotes code consistency and organization</li>
	      		<li>Encourages best practices and design patterns</li>
	      		<li>Helps manage security risks with tested solutions</li>
	      		<li>Makes maintenance and scaling easier</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>
	      		Frameworks also support collaboration by giving teams a shared structure and language to work with, reducing confusion and improving productivity.

	    	<h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>
	    	<p>Web frameworks are generally divided into two categories:</p>
	    	<ol>
	      		<li>
	        		<strong>Frontend Frameworks</strong><br><br>
	        		These frameworks are used to build the part of the application users see and interact with in their web browser. They focus on layout, animations, data presentation, and user interaction. Examples include <em>React</em>, <em>Vue.js</em>, and <em>Angular</em>.
	      		</li> <br>
	      		<li>
	        		<strong>Backend Frameworks</strong><br><br>
	        		These frameworks run on the server and handle data storage, processing, and communication with the frontend. They are responsible for business logic, user authentication, and database integration. Examples include <em>Django</em> (Python), <em>Laravel</em> (PHP), <em>Ruby on Rails</em> (Ruby), and <em>Express</em> (Node.js).
	      		</li>
	    	</ol>
	    	<p>
	      		Some frameworks, known as <strong>full-stack frameworks</strong>, offer tools for both frontend and backend development in one package.
	    	</p>

	    	<h3>Popular Web Frameworks</h3>
		    <ul>
		      	<li>
		        	<strong>React:</strong> Developed by Facebook, React is a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. It’s component-based and widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs).
		      	</li>
		      	<li>
		       		<strong>Django:</strong> A Python framework that emphasizes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django includes many built-in features and is known for its security and scalability.
		      	</li>
		      	<li>
		        	<strong>Laravel:</strong> A modern PHP framework with elegant syntax. Laravel simplifies many tasks common in web projects, such as routing, authentication, and caching.
		      	</li>
		      	<li>
		        	<strong>Express:</strong> A minimalist web framework for Node.js that enables fast development of server-side applications and APIs.
		      	</li>
		    </ul>
